## Set it to true to to activate card settings
USE_CARD_SETTINGS=false

## Example 1: The team has a winrate of 50%, you own 5/5 cards of it. The API will pretend the team has a 74% WR.
## Example 2: The team has a winrate of 50%, you own 1/4 cards of it. The API will pretend the team has a 48.5% WR (50 + (1/4 * 24) - (3 * 2.5)
## Example 3: The team has a winrate of 50%, you own 0/4 cards of it. The API will pretend the team has a 40% WR.
WINRATE_MODIFIER_OWNED_CARD_PERCENTAGE=24
FLAT_NEGATIVE_MODIFIER_PER_UNOWNED_CARD=2.5

## Example: If you finished in silver last season the modifiers above will only be applied
## once you are in silver or higher
DISABLE_OWNED_CARDS_PREFERENCE_BEFORE_CHEST_LEAGUE_RATING=true

## Example: If you finished in silver last season the bot will not prioritize the quest focus element
## before you are in silver or higher
DISABLE_FOCUS_PRIORITY_BEFORE_CHEST_LEAGUE_RATING=true

## Only play cards with this level or higher
CARD_MIN_LEVEL=1

## Always add 0 mana cards like Furious Chicken if the account has it
ADD_ZERO_MANA_CARDS=true

## If set to false the bot will never play any starter cards. Only recommended if you have a ton of cards
PLAY_STARTER_CARDS=true

## Possible options: dragon,death,fire,earth,water,life
## Example: You only want to play earth and fire elements if the bot is not fighting for the quest focus:
## PREFERRED_SUMMONER_ELEMENTS=earth,fire
PREFERRED_SUMMONER_ELEMENTS=dragon,death,fire,earth,water,life

## If the API can not find a team with your preferred summoner elements with a winrate >= this
## it will chose a team without element restrictions applied
PREFERRED_SUMMONER_ELEMENTS_WINRATE_THRESHOLD=48

## If PRIORITIZE_QUEST=true then the API will always try to play the focus element, unless it can not find
## A team with a winrate >= this
USE_FOCUS_ELEMENT_WINRATE_THRESHOLD=55

##### DEPRECATED - only working for old API and will probably be removed soon:

## The minimum amount of historic games the api should have for a team to consider it
MINIMUM_GAMES=10

## Possible options: dragon,death,fire,earth,water,life
PREFERRED_SUMMONER_ELEMENT=

## If the api only finds teams with a winrate smaller than this it will ignore the card settings
## (0-100)
WINRATE_THRESHOLD=40
